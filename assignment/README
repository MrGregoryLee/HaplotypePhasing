Haplotype Phasing from Genotypes with Missing Data

Run from the code folder with command
  
  python unmask.py [example number] [block size]
  
where the example numbers are {1,2}
and the block size specifies how many snps to consider in each block

For example, running the command
  python unmask.py 1 10 will produce output
  ../output/example_data_1_block_10_sol.txt

Then you can test the accuracy with
  Rscript calculate_switch_accuracy.R ../data/example_data_1_sol.txt ../output/example_data_1_block_10_sol.txt
